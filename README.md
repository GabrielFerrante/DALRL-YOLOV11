# DALRL-YOLOV11 (Deep Active Learning with Reinforcement Learning in YOLOV11)

### Novel pipeline for training with few labeled data samples based in average entropy/confiances of bounding boxes.

The approach begins by separating the COCO training dataset into two parts. The first for actually training the Yolo models, and the other, called the Pool, for selecting new images for the training set. In addition, the COCO validation set is used. 


Separation takes place in two ways. The first is through random selection and the second is through clustering. For the random approach, 20% of the total training data is chosen. For the clustering approach, the K-Means algorithm is used (it could be any other algorithm that uses distances in a 2-D space) to group embeddings generated by a classic resnet-18  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), applied to the images in the set. In the end, 80 clusters are created (from each COCO class) and the center of the cluster and 20% of the edge samples (which are on the borders of the cluster with neighboring clusters) are chosen for training. Note that this approach is active learning based on an image pool.


With the data separated, an initial YoloV11 (Ultralytics version (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17725)) model is trained (one model for each training selection strategy).  This initial model is used to train a PPO (Proximal policy optimization (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)) reinforcement learning agent, which, together with the Yolo model, forms the environment. The agent is trained with the data in the Pool set, and uses the average entropy and average confidence of the bounding boxes of the Yolo model detections to take image selection actions, which are included in the reward/penalty functions.

With the agents created, the selection stage is carried out on the Pool set, with the limitation of selecting 1% of the images. These images are then moved to the training set. In the next step, a new YoloV11 model is trained and validated on the validation set. If the model outperforms the reference model from the original YoloV11 paper on COCO in the bounding box accuracy metric in the training stage, it is chosen as the best model. If not, the agent is retrained and the cycle starts again.

The aim of the project is to try to achieve an precision of the detected bounding boxes equal to or better than the reference model, using less training data.

## Speed Start

- Run data preparation (Files: PrepareDatas-EmbeddingClustering.ipynb and PrepareDatas-Random.ipynb)
    - Note: It is set for the COCO dataset 2017. Evaluate and modify if necessary for your dataset.

- Run the initial training of the YoloV11 models with each initial set. (**File**: beforeCicle.py)

- Change the training hyperparameters of the agents and Yolo if necessary.

- Start the cycle (adjust the number of cycles. Default: 10). (**File**: cicle.py)

- In case of an error: Check GPU memory consumption. Modify the checkpoint to restart the cycle from where it stopped. (**File**: active_learning_logs\active_learning_checkpoint.json)

- Avoid running other tasks on the GPU, as this may cause the algorithm to crash.
